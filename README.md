# Beat'em Up

I started this project as an exercise on how to make a 
Beat'em Up game from the ground up.

## Dependencies

This game is being developed on [Love2D](https://love2d.org/). You need it to
run the project.

The sprites are being made using [Krita](https://krita.org/en/).

## Execution

First of all, the project should be cloned:

```
git clone https://github.com/ishiikurisu/BeatemUp
cd BeatemUp
```

Then, you need to execute the project's code:

```
love game --terminal
```
